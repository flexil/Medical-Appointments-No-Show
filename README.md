Medical Appointments No-Show Data Analysis And Visualization Udacity scholarrship

medical appointment No- show dataset consists of 100k medical appointments in Brazil as part of the Advanced Data Analytics Nanodegree Scholarship by Udacity which seeks to equip and to train young Africans for digital technologies and skills for remote work and local market opportunities. The dataset collects information from more than 100k medical appointments in Brazil and it is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. In the following, we explore:<br>
- Pie plot of No-show patients
- Pie plot of gender,hypertenstion and No-show
- Pie plot of gender,diabetes and No-show
- Pie plot of gender,SMS_received and No-show
- Pie plot of gender and No-show
- No-show gender distribution
- Diabetes No-show gender distribution
- Hypertension No-show gender distribution
- SMS_received No-show gender distribution
- Age No-show gender distribution

Limitations

The dataset submit to our analysis in this project contains some data entry errors which affect the outcome of our analysis. Out of the 110,527 observations, we found a negative Age in observation row index 99832 of the observations. Moreover, we found out that there were 3539 observations having Age value to be 0. We assumed those discrepancies were some errors therefore we dropped 3,540 observations. Our analysis was carried out on 106,987 observations after cleaning the dataset which did not represent the actual population of the patients which might change the outcome of our result. We further need to know the distance of the patients to the nearest hospital where the appointment has been booked to figure out which few patients respond to their medical appointment. We need further to know why the hospital prefers text message over phone call since most of people don't read they sms often.
